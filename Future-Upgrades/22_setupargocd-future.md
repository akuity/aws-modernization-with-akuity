# ðŸš€ Creating Your Argo CD Instance

Now that we have kubectl access to our EKS cluster, let's set up an Argo CD instance on the Akuity platform.

## Create an Argo CD Instance

1. Log in to the [Akuity Platform](https://akuity.cloud) and navigate to **Argo CD**

2. Click **+ Create** in the upper right corner of the dashboard

3. Enter a name for your instance (e.g., `workshop-argocd`)

4. Optionally add a description to help identify this instance

5. Click **+ Create** to initialize your instance

::alert[Your Argo CD instance will begin initializing. This process takes a few minutes. You'll know it's complete when the cogwheel next to your instance name stops turning and the status shows a ðŸ’š healthy indicator.]{header="Note"}

## Configure Your Argo CD Admin Account

1. In the dashboard for your Argo CD instance, click **Settings**

2. On the sidebar, under **Security & Access**, click **System Accounts**

3. Enable the **Admin Account** by clicking the toggle and confirming when prompted

4. Set your admin password by clicking **Set Password**

   ::alert[Keep this password handy! You'll need it to access the Argo CD UI.]{header="Important"}

5. Wait for Argo CD to reinitialize (the cogwheel will spin and then stop)

6. Access your Argo CD instance by clicking the instance URL in the **Summary** tab
   
   Your URL will look similar to: `123456letters.cd.akuity.cloud`

7. At the Argo CD login screen, enter `admin` as the username and use the password you set in step 4

## Connect Your EKS Cluster

1. In your Argo CD instance dashboard, click **Clusters**

2. Click **Connect a Cluster**

3. Set your cluster name to `eks-cluster`

4. Optionally add a description with your EKS cluster's name

5. Click **Advanced Settings**

6. On the Add-Ons tab, locate the **AWS EKS** option

7. Click **+Add** on the AWS EKS option

8. Click **Connect Cluster** to proceed

9. You'll be prompted to install the agent using either the AWS Console or AWS CLI

   Follow the instructions for your preferred method

10. Verify you're targeting the correct cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl config current-context
    ```

    The output should look similar to:
    ```
    arn:aws:eks:us-east-1:338615488317:cluster/cluster-name
    ```

11. Check that the Akuity agent pods are running:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n akuity
    ```

    You should see output similar to:
    ```
    NAME                                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

    akuity-agent-<replicaset-id>-<pod-id>                      1/1     Running   0          65s

    argocd-redis-<replicaset-id>-<pod-id>                      1/1     Running   0          65s
    argocd-repo-server-<replicaset-id>-<pod-id>                1/1     Running   0          64s
    argocd-repo-server-<replicaset-id>-<pod-id>                1/1     Running   0          64s
    ```

::alert[When you see a ðŸ’š green heart before the cluster name in your Argo CD instance, it indicates that your cluster is healthy and properly connected.]{header="Success"}

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your cluster is now set up on the Akuity Platform. The cluster data is uploaded to the platform, so we don't need to repeat this process for Kargo and KubeVision.
