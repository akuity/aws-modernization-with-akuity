# ðŸ”— Connecting to Your EKS Cluster

Before we can deploy applications with Argo CD, we need to configure kubectl to communicate with your EKS cluster.

## AWS Authentication

:::alert{header="Note"}
Since you're using the VS Code server environment, AWS authentication is already configured with a role attached. You can skip the manual authentication steps.
:::

You can verify your AWS authentication by running:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see your AWS account information displayed, confirming that your environment is properly authenticated.

## Configure kubectl for EKS

Make sure you have the `aws` and `kubectl` CLIs installed. If you're using the Workshop Studio environment, these should already be available.

:::steps
1. List your available EKS clusters:

   ```bash
   aws eks list-clusters
   ```

   You should see output similar to:

   ```json
   {
     "clusters": [
       "akuity-aws-cluster"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Create a kubeconfig file for your cluster:

   ```bash
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name akuity-aws-cluster
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use this command to automatically use the first cluster in your account:
   
   ```bash
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name $(aws eks list-clusters | jq -r .clusters[0])
   ```

   This should output:

   ```
   Added new context arn:aws:eks:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/akuity-aws-cluster to /home/vscode/.kube/config
   ```

3. Test your kubectl access:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   You should see output similar to:

   ```
   NAME                              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
   ip-192-168-108-33.ec2.internal    Ready    <none>   2d    v1.31.1-eks-ae9a62a
   ```

::expand[
Let's break down the commands we used:

- `aws eks list-clusters` lists all EKS clusters in your current AWS account and region
- `$(aws eks list-clusters | jq -r .clusters[0])` is a sub-command that:
  - Executes first and provides the output as the value for the `--name` parameter
  - Uses the pipe symbol `|` to pass the output to the next command
  - Uses `jq -r .clusters[0]` to extract the first cluster name from the JSON output
- `aws eks update-kubeconfig` updates your kubeconfig file with the credentials needed to access the specified cluster

Now that kubectl is configured to access your EKS cluster, you're ready to set up your Argo CD instance!
