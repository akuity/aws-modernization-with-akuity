## Understanding Akuity Organizations

An Akuity Organization is a top-level container for your Akuity resources. It allows you to:

- Group related projects and clusters
- Manage user access and permissions
- Configure shared settings
- Track usage and billing

Organizations are particularly useful in enterprise environments where you might have multiple teams or projects using the Akuity Platform.
