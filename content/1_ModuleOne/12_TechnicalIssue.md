## How You Can Mend the Common Pain Points with Kubernetes with a Single AWS Add-On?

Nowadays there are plenty of tools available to address the common pain points for Kubernetes. <br> 
Why use multiple, separate tools or add-ons when you can get an all-in-one package with the **Akuity Platform Agent**?

The **Akuity Platform Agent** allows users to install the Akuity Platform directly into their EKS cluster. This provides solutions to aforementioned pain points such as: <br>

- **Better Visibility**: Allows users deeper insights into their clusters' status, resources, and provides a visual for deployments and code promotion.
- **Better Scalability**: Akuity's unique [agent-based architecture](https://akuity.io/blog/argo-cd-architectures-explained) makes scaling easier by running a dedicated application controller and repo server in each manager cluster. Using this approach simplifies any scalability challenges encountered since the work is no longer distrubuted across all clusters.
- **Better Security**: Another perk of our agent-based architecture enables clusters access to the Argo Control plane which in turn allows secrets (such as sensitive information) to stay safe inside the cluster.
- **Better Resource Organization**: Manage your cluster's resources with ease with KubeVision. KubeVision exposes the data already collected from your deployments, so the information is readily available.
- **Better Cluster Monitoring**: When an error occurs, the error is logged in KubeVision and presents suggestions to aid in troubleshooting. Users can use KubeVision Timeline view to keep track of a cluster's status and any errors that may have occurred during a specific timeframe.
