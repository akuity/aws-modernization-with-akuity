We at Akuity understand the complexities of working with Kubernetes and have created a simpler, faster, inexpensive solution for all the common pain points of working with Kubernetes:<br>

- Lack of Visibility
- Lack of Scalability
- Lack of Security
- Lack of Organization of Resources
- Lack of Efficent Monitoring for Clusters

The **Akuity Platform** offers a unique agent-based architecture that allows the cluster to connect to the Argo control plane, which in turn keeps secrets safe inside the cluster.
