# Introduction: Akuity
The Akuity Platform was developed with the goal to improve teams' overall experience with working with Kubernetes. With the Akuity Platform, you can: 
- **Deploy** with Managed Argo CD on the Akuity Platform. Utilize Akuity's unique architecture to deliver managed Argo CD via enterprise and self-managed options. This unique architecture lowers cost, increases security, and removes complexity.
- **Promote** with Kargo, a multi-stage GitOps promotion tool and application lifecycle orchestration platform for Kubernetes created by the minds behind Argo CD. Kargo ensures effective stage-to-stage promotion using GitOps principles. 
- **Gain Visibility** of your resources of all Kubernetes clusters. Stay on top of critical events and reduce recovery time with time-based view of events. Harness the power of AI in managing your clusters.
