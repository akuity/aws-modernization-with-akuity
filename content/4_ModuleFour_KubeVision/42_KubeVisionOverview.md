Sometimes, deprecated APIs cause all sorts of trouble in an application. The Deprecated APIs Dashboard helps you stay on top of obsolete APIs.

## Stuck in Deletion Resources

KubeVision’s Timeline view is a game changer. As stated above, you can go back as far as 14 days. The Akuity Platform stores and displays information on critical workload events, making it a fantastic debugging tool. 

## Tree View
