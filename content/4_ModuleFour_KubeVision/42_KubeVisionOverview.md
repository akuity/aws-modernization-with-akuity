# ðŸ“Š Exploring KubeVision Dashboards

KubeVision provides several specialized dashboards to help you monitor and manage your Kubernetes clusters. Let's explore each one.

## Explorer Dashboard

![Explorer Dashboard](/images/KubeVisionExplorer.png)

The Explorer Dashboard is your central hub for browsing cluster resources. It provides a comprehensive view of all resources in your cluster, organized in a way that makes them easy to find and understand.

### Customizing Your View

You can tailor the Explorer Dashboard to your specific needs using the dropdown filters at the top:

Filter by:
- Namespace
- Resource type
- Status
- Labels
- And more

:::alert{header="Tip"}
The Explorer Dashboard is a great starting point for investigating issues or getting a high-level overview of your cluster's resources.

## Deprecated APIs Dashboard

The Deprecated APIs Dashboard helps you identify and address obsolete Kubernetes APIs in your cluster. This is crucial for maintaining compatibility with future Kubernetes versions.

### Proactive API Management

For each deprecated API, KubeVision provides:
- The current API version being used
- The recommended replacement API version
- The number of resources affected
- When the API will be removed

## Stuck in Deletion Dashboard

This specialized dashboard identifies resources that have been stuck in the deletion state for more than 1 hour. These resources can cause issues with cluster management and should be addressed.

::::expand{header="Common Causes for Stuck Deletions"}
Resources can get stuck in deletion due to:
- Finalizers that haven't completed
- Dependencies that haven't been resolved
- Custom resource controllers that aren't functioning properly
- Networking issues preventing proper cleanup

## Container Dashboard

![Container Dashboard](/images/KubeVisionContainers.png)

The Container Dashboard provides detailed information about all containers running in your cluster, with powerful filtering capabilities.

### Resource Utilization Insights

Filter containers by:
- Resource usage
- Resource limits
- Resource requests

![Containers Resources](/images/KubeVisionContainersResource.png)

You can sort by memory or CPU usage (click the arrows next to "Memory") to quickly identify the most resource-intensive containers. This is invaluable for optimizing resource allocation and identifying potential issues.

## Image Dashboard

![Images Dashboard](/images/KubeVisionImages.png)

The Image Dashboard provides comprehensive information about all container images used in your cluster.

### Image Details

For each image, you can see:
- Image name
- Number of containers using the image
- Image tags (to identify different versions)
- Digest (if applicable)
- CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

![CVE Information](/images/KubeVisionCVEs.png)

:::alert{header="Security Note"}
CVE scanning is available for public images. Enable CVE scanning in KubeVision settings to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
:::

You can also find CVE information in the **Security** tab of your Argo CD instance.

## Infrastructure Dashboard

The Infrastructure dashboard offers two perspectives: **Pods** and **Nodes**.

### Pods View

In the Pods view, you can group by:
- Cluster
- Availability Zone
- Region
- Node

![Pods View](/images/InfrastructurePodsrunning.png)

### Nodes View

In the Nodes view, you can group by:
- CPU Utilization
- Memory Utilization
- Pod Count
- Pod Utilization

![Infrastructure Nodes](/images/InfrastructureNode.png)

This dashboard is particularly useful for understanding how your workloads are distributed across your infrastructure and identifying potential imbalances.

## Timeline View

![Timeline](/images/KubeVisionTimeline1.png)

The Timeline view captures events and errors in real-time, providing a chronological view of what's happening in your cluster.

### Event Tracking

You can:
- Set the time period for displayed events
- Filter by event type
- Search for specific events

The timeline shows critical workload events, which is invaluable for troubleshooting deployment failures, promotion issues, cluster health changes, and more.

Yellow circles with Kargo's logo indicate issues with Kargo. Clicking on these events provides detailed information about what went wrong and when.

## AI Assistant

   ![Extensions](/images/AkuityExtensions.png)

4. Find **Akuity Assistant** and click **Install**

5. Once installed, go to the **Explorer** dashboard and click on any resource

6. A new **Assistant** tab will appear, allowing you to ask questions about the resource
   
   ![AI Assistant Details](/images/AkuityAIAssist2.png)

The AI Assistant can help you:
- Analyze deployment logs
- Review deployment issues
- Suggest optimizations
- Explain resource configurations
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
