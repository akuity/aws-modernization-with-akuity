## Log in to Kargo CLI



1. In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kargo login https://<your-instance-URL> \
   --admin \
   --password <password> \
   --insecure-skip-tls-verify
   ```

   Replace:
   - `<your-instance-URL>` with your Kargo instance URL (without the `https://` prefix)
   - `<password>` with the admin password you set earlier

2. Verify successful login (you should see a confirmation message)


ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You're now logged in to Kargo and ready to set up your promotion workflow.
