# ðŸš¢ Promote with Kargo on AWS

![Kargo Example](/images/KargoIndex.png)

## Streamlined Promotion Workflows for AWS Environments

In this module, we'll explore Kargo, Akuity's powerful promotion engine that helps you move code through different AWS environments in a controlled, automated way.

### What You'll Learn

- How to set up a Kargo instance for your AWS environments
- How to create projects, warehouses, and stages representing your AWS deployment pipeline
- How to configure promotion workflows between AWS environments
- How to promote changes between development, staging, and production on AWS

### Why This Matters for AWS Customers

Kargo solves several critical challenges in the application delivery process on AWS:

- **AWS Environment Consistency** - Ensure applications are deployed consistently across AWS environments
- **Controlled Promotions** - Move code through AWS environments with proper validation
- **Visibility** - Track what version is deployed where in your AWS infrastructure
- **Automation** - Reduce manual steps in the promotion process across AWS accounts and regions

Let's get started by setting up Kargo using the Argo CD instance we created for our Amazon EKS cluster in the previous module!
