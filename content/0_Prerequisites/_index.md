# üèÅ Getting Started

Welcome to the AWS Modernization Workshop with Akuity! Before we dive into the technical content, let's make sure your environment is properly set up.

## Choose Your Workshop Environment

Select the appropriate option based on how you're participating in this workshop:

::tabs{name="workshop-type"}

::tab{name="AWS Hosted Event" active=true}
If you're attending an AWS hosted event (such as re:Invent, an AWS Summit, or an AWS-organized online workshop), your environment will be provided for you.

[Set up for an AWS hosted event](./aws_event)

Your instructor will provide:
- Temporary AWS account credentials
- Pre-configured EKS cluster details
- Additional workshop-specific instructions
::

::tab{name="Self-Paced"}
If you're running the workshop on your own, you'll need to set up the required AWS resources.

[Set up for self-paced workshop](./self_paced)

You'll need to:
- Use your own AWS account
- Create an EKS cluster
- Install and configure the necessary tools
- Follow additional setup instructions
